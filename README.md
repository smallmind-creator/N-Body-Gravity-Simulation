# N-Body Gravitational Interaction

This repository contains a Bachelor's Thesis project exploring the classical N-Body Problem.

## Overview
The script models the gravitational interaction between multiple objects in 3D space using numerical integration. It visualizes the trajectories and orbital stability over time.
The script allows the loading and saving of initial configurations via JSON, including mass, entity names, physical constants, and velocity vectors. 
Additionally, it supports the export of calculated results in CSV format.
